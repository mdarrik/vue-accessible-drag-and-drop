# Accessible Drag & Drop List Built in Vue

This is an ongoing project to build an accessible-first drag & drop list in Vue. It is heavily inspired by Dragon Drop https://github.com/schne324/dragon-drop and the [associated article in Smashing Mag](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/dragon-drop-accessible-list-reordering/).
